# Prime Number Checker

This repository contains a Python implementation for checking whether a given number is a prime number. 

It's a **self-learning code** that improves the accuracy of prime number predictions over time. 

The self-learning process is visualized using a correct rate chart, demonstrating the increasing correctness of predictions with each execution.

This is an experiment, aimed at improving correctness over multiple executions. Note that the accuracy may vary depending on the nature of input numbers.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code, and contributions are welcome!

**Disclaimer:** The self-learning code assumes random and finite input numbers. It may not perform well with intentionally crafted edge cases.
